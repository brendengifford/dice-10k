JavaScript Dice Game

This project was an attempt to recreate the dice game, Ten Thousand using JavaScript. 

If you're not familiar with Ten Thousand, check out the Wikipedia page on it: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_10000

Having little experience in JavaScript, there are naturally some less than elegant solutoins in this code. However, it works solidly and acomplishes what I set out to do, so I'm pretty happy with it.
